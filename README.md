## description

***
As an avid cook; I want to browse through recipes, set filters as my search options, create a collection of mine and listen to the instructions. Recipes Outloud aims to equip you with various tools to achieve this goal and make cooking more fun then ever!<br>
Recipes OutLoud App answers these needs and presents an easy to use interactive UI. The app was developed using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It also utilizes Tailwindcss at the front end and it's been set up to allow users to save recipe searches to the back end. All search data is sourced from Spoonacular API and React-Speech is used as the text to speech technology. The app was deployed to Heroku through MongoDB Atlas.
